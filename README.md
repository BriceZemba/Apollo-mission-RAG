# Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-for-Trading-research-paper

## Project Overview
This project explores the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to enhance trading strategies. Specifically, it focuses on leveraging reinforcement learning to develop a trading bot that learns and adapts to market conditions.

## File Details
- **File Type**: PDF
- **File Name**: `Trading Bot using Reinforcement Learning.pdf`

## Key Features
1. **Reinforcement Learning**: The project employs reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize trading strategies.
2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Combines retrieval methods and generative models to improve decision-making.
3. **Automated Trading**: Implements an automated bot capable of executing trades based on learned policies.
